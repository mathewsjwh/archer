# Setup:  

1. Copy `Build and Run (Simulator).ps1` into your project. You can run this PowerShell script manually to build and run on the simulator, including task management.
2. Copy the `/.vscode` directory into your project. This may involve splicing `.json` files. This orchestrates the actions necessary for running the above script automatically on build.
3. If there are issues with any of the commands in the PowerShell script, try running the `ADD_ENV_VARIABLE.cmd` script.
